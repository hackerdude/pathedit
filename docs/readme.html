	<P>PathEdit is a mini-development tool. It is designed for rearranging
	PATH-style environment variables inside shell and Windows batch files.

	<P>Under java, CLASSPATH variables can get out of hand very fast. With
	multiple versions of the same classes on different JAR files, sometimes
	the order the classes are listed in a particular CLASSPATH matter.

	<P>PathEdit allows you to, while leaving the rest of your shell file
	unchanged, change the order of the environment variables, and add new
	elements to the variables.
